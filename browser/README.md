# Persona Browser Targets

This directory contains the scaffolding for Persona's browser-surface work:

- `chromium-extension` – Chrome/Edge WebExtension skeleton built with TypeScript.
- `safari-extension` – Swift host app + shared manifest for Safari WebExtension distribution.

Each sub-project is intentionally minimal so we can iterate in small steps (one feature per commit) while
keeping ownership boundaries clear.
